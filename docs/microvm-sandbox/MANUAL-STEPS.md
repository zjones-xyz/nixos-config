# microvm-sandbox — manual steps

Things that can't be done from this authoring session (no access to Pegasus hardware,
no fleet secrets) or that are one-time operator actions. Filled in as each phase lands;
empty sections below are placeholders for phases not yet implemented.

## Phase 0 — none

Pure documentation phase; nothing to do on hardware yet.

## Phase 1 — guest boot — ✅ VERIFIED on Pegasus (2026-07-20/21)

**Gate passed.** All three criteria confirmed live — see `DECISIONS.md`'s "Phase 1 —
operator verification" section for the full account, including three real bugs found and
fixed along the way (missing-subvolume emergency-mode risk, `systemd-networkd` deleting
Tailscale's ip rules, `microvm`-user permission denied on fresh subvolumes). What follows
is the as-verified checklist, kept for anyone re-running this from scratch (e.g. after a
reinstall) rather than a still-open TODO:

1. **Create the two btrfs subvolumes on the real disk before first switch** — this step
   was missed during the actual first attempt and cascaded into a host-wide emergency-mode
   boot (see `DECISIONS.md`). `nofail` is now on both mounts specifically so a repeat of
   this mistake degrades to "guest doesn't start" instead of "Pegasus doesn't boot," but
   doing this step first is still the right move:
   ```
   mount /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt   # or wherever it's mounted at subvol=/ (top-level)
   btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@microvm-store
   btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@microvm-state
   umount /mnt
   ```
2. KVM access, `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#pegasus`, and the `10.100.0.0/24` addressing
   all confirmed clean on real hardware (LAN is `192.168.8.x`–`192.168.10.x`, no collision).
3. **Confirmed: there is no genuine interactive console into the guest** — the systemd unit
   wires the guest's console up as journal *output* only (no `StandardInput=`), so nothing
   can be typed into it. Phase 1's gate (writable `/nix`, `nix build`, outbound internet)
   was verified instead via an automated boot-time self-check
   (`systemd.services.phase1-verify` in the guest module) whose `PASS`/`FAIL` surfaces
   through `journalctl -u microvm@agent-sandbox` on the host. This stays in place until
   Phase 3's SSH makes direct interactive checks possible.
4. **Confirmed: `microvm@<name>.service` has `restartIfChanged = false`.** A host
   `nixos-rebuild switch` does **not** restart an already-running guest — pick up any
   guest-internal config change with an explicit
   `sudo systemctl restart microvm@agent-sandbox` afterward.
5. **Phase 1 has no network containment** (confirmed: wide-open NAT egress). The guest can
   currently reach the LAN and tailnet — Phase 2 adds the denylist. Don't leave a
   Phase-1-only guest running unattended.

## Phase 2 — network policy (once code lands)

- From inside the guest: confirm internet reachable; confirm **every other fleet host is
  unreachable** (memory-alpha, hopper, hamilton, Serenity, and Pegasus's own
  LAN/tailnet addresses/services including Olla:40114) — this is the containment proof,
  test it explicitly, don't assume the rules are right from reading them.
  Suggested checks from inside the guest:
  ```
  curl -sS -m5 https://cache.nixos.org > /dev/null && echo "internet: OK"
  ping -c1 -W2 100.<memory-alpha-tailnet-ip> && echo "LEAK: tailnet reachable" || echo "tailnet: blocked (expected)"
  curl -sS -m3 http://<pegasus-tailnet-ip>:40114 && echo "LEAK: Olla reachable" || echo "Olla: blocked (expected)"
  ```
- Confirm the forwarded dev port is reachable from Pegasus itself but from nowhere else
  (not the LAN, not the tailnet) — test from a second fleet host, expect failure.
- Confirm the above holds with Docker running on Pegasus (not just at idle) — Docker's own
  iptables management is a known risk flagged in DECISIONS.md.

## Phase 3 — agent user, Docker, agents (once code lands)

- **Mint `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`** — see SECRETS-TODO.md.
- **Mint the Codex token** — see SECRETS-TODO.md.
- **Generate the guest's own SSH host key ceremony** — see SECRETS-TODO.md (this is the
  guest's sops age identity; must happen before its `secrets/<guest>.yaml` can be created).
- Confirm from Pegasus: `ssh -J z@pegasus.<tailnet> agent@<guest-ip>` reaches the guest;
  add the `sandbox` Host alias to `~/.ssh/config` on Serenity (see the plan's "Operator
  access" section for the exact stanza).
- Confirm a Docker Postgres container comes up inside the guest.
- Confirm a sample web dev server is reachable on the forwarded port from Pegasus.
- Confirm Claude Code authenticates headlessly using the subscription token (not an API key).

## Phase 4 — build-verification (once code lands)

- Inside the guest as `agent`: `nix flake check` against a checkout of this flake, with
  **no sops age keys present** on the guest — confirm it still passes (this is the point
  of the exercise: the guest can validate configs without holding any fleet secrets).
- `nix build .#nixosConfigurations.<host>.config.system.build.toplevel` for an x86_64 host
  (pegasus or memory-alpha — not hopper/hamilton without binfmt) to completion, pulling
  from `cache.nixos.org`.

## Phase 5 — snapshot/reset + docs (once code lands)

- Take a first btrbk snapshot of the guest's state volume; confirm it lands in
  `/.snapshots` (Pegasus's existing `@snapshots` subvolume) and is listed by the `btrbk`
  CLI.
- Do one full rollback drill: intentionally modify something inside the guest's state
  volume, stop the guest, restore the snapshot, restart, confirm the change is gone.
- Confirm `nix eval` succeeds for the memory-alpha 4 GB stub (evaluated only — not booted,
  not deployed).
